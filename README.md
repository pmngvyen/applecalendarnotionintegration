# applecalendarnotionintegration

Hello, this is a running project, still under development, that streamlines the event management process by allowing users to 
automatically move events from their Apple Calendar into Notion's database. 

In order to have the code working, you are required to pull your own Apple Calendar Client ID and Secret, as well as your Notion API Key and database ID. 
You can retrieve your Apple API ID and Secret through the Apple Developer's program. You can search this up on Google to find a more detailed process.
Your Notion API key and database ID can be found in the integrations portion of the Notion API interface. The database ID can be found in the url of the 
database. These can also be search on Google to find a more detailed process. 

Additionally, continue to add comments and contact me at paul.nguyen1209@gmail.com in order to fix and issues with the code.


NOTE: There are still many flaws within the script, as it is still only in it's beta phase. I am not responsible for any issues caused by this script.
